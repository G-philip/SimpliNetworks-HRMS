Worked towards creating an SPA SYSTEM where i created a reusable modal that accepts any form widget from any file it's being called from. whether it's edit or add new object. for the invoice management system. it only creates one invoice ITEM and as of 23rd March 2025 I haven't yet figured out how i will add more ITEMS to the created INVOICE but I'm working on an idea I have and in a few days when I have time it will be done.
An Invoice contains one or multiple items/services
On main.dart change case '/':
        page = const Layout(child: InvoiceScreen()); 
        to
        case '/':
        page = const Layout(child: LoginScreen());
